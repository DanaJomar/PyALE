    """Compute the accumulated local effect (ALE) of a feature on a model.
    
    This function computes the effect of one (continuous, discrete, or categorical) 
    feature, or two features on a given model.
    Some arguments in the function are relevant for a specific type of effect only,
    while others are relevant for all types. Irrelevant arguments will be ignored.
    The table bellow shows which arguments are for which type of effect relevant, 
    and what is (if any) the default value for each.

    Arguments:
    X 
    ---- 
        A pandas DataFrame to pass to the model for prediction.
    model 
    ---- 
        Any python model with a predict method that accepts X as input, 
        and return numeric predictions (the predictions for regression tasks and 
        the probability for two-class classification tasks).
    feature 
    ---- 
        List of strings, the name of the column (or columns) holding the feature(s)
        to analyze, accepts at most two features.
    feature_type 
    ---- 
        String, one of 'auto', 'discrete', 'continuous', or 'categorical' specifying 
        the type of values the feature has. Default is 'auto', in this case:
            * any non-numeric feature is considered categorical
            * for numeric features the number of unique values is tested, if the  
            the feature has less than 11 unique values or at most 0.2% of sample 
            size (i.e. #uniqueValues/#samples <= 0.002, that is 20 values for a  
            sample of 10,000) then the feature is considered discrete, otherwise 
            it's continuous.
    grid_size 
    ---- 
        An integer indicating the number of intervals into which the feature range
        is divided.
    include_CI 
    ---- 
        A boolean, if True the confidence interval of the effect is returned with 
        the results. 
    C 
    ----
        A float, the confidence level for which to compute the confidence interval.
    encode_fun
    ---- 
        Function, used to encode the categorical feature, usually a  one-hot encoder. 
        The function's input and output are as follows
            * input: a DataFrame with one column (the feature)
            * output: a DataFrame with the new column(s) encoding the feature. 
        It is also important that this function should be able to handle missing 
        categories (for example, a one-hot-encoder applied to a column, in which not 
        all categories occur, should add a column of zeros for each missing category). 
        Examples of use of this function could be found in the README file in github 
        or in the description of the package in PyPI https://pypi.org/project/PyALE/.
    predictors
    ---- 
        List or array of strings containing the names of features used in the model,
        and in the right order.
    plot 
    ---- 
        A boolean indicating whether to plot the effects or not.
    contour 
    ---- 
        A boolean indicating if the heatmap for 2D effects should have labeled 
        contours over it.
    fig, ax 
    ---- 
        matplotlib figure and axis.
    
    Return:
        For 1D effects: A pandas DataFrame containing for each bin or value: the 
        size of the sample in it, the accumulated centered effect, and the 
        confidence interval of the effect if include_CI is True.
        For 2D effects: A grid of effects as a pandas DataFrame containing for 
        each bin in the grid the accumulated centered effect of this bin.
